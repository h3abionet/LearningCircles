# H3ABioNet Learning Circles

Welcome to [H3ABioNet](https://www.mozillascience.org/)'s Learning Circle project! From here, we'll set you up with everything you need to start your own Learning Circle.

### Wait, What's  'H3ABioNet Learning Circles'

H3ABioNet Learning circles, modelled after H3ABioNet Learning Circles, are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and explore open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers. **Anyone can start a Study Group-- you don't have to be an expert coder to do so!**


## For New Organizers
 If you think you might want to start your group, [Learning Circles Website](https://www.h3abionet.org/component/sppagebuilder/192-open-learning-circles) provides a quick start guide for starting a one. Also, have a look at the [The Study Group Orientation Guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/index.html), which covers running Group meetings, the super-easy setup of your Learning Circle website, collaborating online using GitHub, an introduction to open research practice, and more. Take a look at the [About section here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/1-about-study-groups.html) and the article on the [Learning Circle Lead role](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/1.1-lead-role.html)-- these should help you figure out if you'd like to start a learning Circle.  

* **Watch Orientation Videos:** As part of the H3ABioNet IBT training, we will provide an introduction to the learning Circles, with the videos available from [Link to the Videos]().

* **Read the code of conduct:** this Learning Circle Program is for everyone in Africa - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone is treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!

* **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).

# About Mozilla Study Groups

The Mozilla Science Lab was sunsetted in September of 2018. While we had hoped to find a partnership with another organization to take the Study Group work forward, it did not take place.  Please feel free to use the materials hosted here to build your own Learning Circles, though keep in mind that Mozilla is no longer actively supporting this program.

Our heartfelt :sparkling_heart: and appreciation to all the Study Group Leads and participants who made this program the success that it was.

Much of the work done by the Science Lab has moved on in some way under the Open Leadership & Events Team.  If you're interested in that work, you can see how that work is being continued on [their website](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/open-leadership-events/).
